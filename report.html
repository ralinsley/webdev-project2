    <h2>How to use</h2>
    <p> This is a simple database with only one table, and two columns (not including the SERIAL id). First is "secret" which is a
        TEXT field for a or any random thought. Second is "secret_type" which is VARCHAR(20) - up to 20
        characters but preferably one word that describes the general category/type for the secret. And here are example
        requests to test the endpoints. (Please don't put any actual secrets in here)<br><br>Create:
    <pre>curl --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \     
            --data '{"secret": "xx xx xx xx x.", "secret_type": "xxxx"}' \
            https://project2.apolity.me:8443/confess</pre>
    <br>Read: visit url: https://project2.apolity.me:8443/get to return all secrets in the database and
    https://project2.apolity.me:8443/get/id to return a secret with that "id".
    <br><br>Update: where "id" matches the id of the secret to update.
    <pre>curl --HEADER 'Content-Type: application/json' 
     --request PATCH --data 
     '{"secret": "xx xx xx xx x.", "secret_type": "xxxx"}' 
        https://project2.apolity.me:8443/update/id</pre>
    <br><br>Delete: curl --request DELETE https://project2.apolity.me:8443/delete/id
